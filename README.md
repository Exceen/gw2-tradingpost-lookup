# gw2-tradingpost-lookup
Looks up a specific item name and its recipe, calculates the cheapest price and displays the profit/loss when traded

# requirements
If you want to use this script, you'll need the gw2api wrapper: https://github.com/Exceen/gw2api/

Simply run the file and enter the name of your item. Note that it uses the item-search from http://www.gw2spidy.com/api/v0.9/json/item-search/, this script just processes the output.

# issues
I know that there are still a lot of issues with this script, but most of the time it will work just fine. I barely find any recipes that don't work here. Especially performance-wise this script is probably just a huge mess, but I'm too lazy to improve it because I've developed this script just for personal use actually.

In case you find some issues, I probably know them already but I'm happy if you message me anyway, so I'm able to might fix them in the near future.
